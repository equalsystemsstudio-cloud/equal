    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="meta">Effective: January 4, 2026</p>

    <p>Equal (the “App”) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices. By using the App, you agree to this Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> name, email, username, profile details you provide when you create or update your account.</li>

      <li><strong>Device & Log Data:</strong> device type, OS version, app version, IP address, and basic diagnostics for performance, security, and troubleshooting.</li>
      <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> approximate or precise location if you grant permission (used for location tags, geofeatures, or content relevance).</li>
      <li><strong>Media Access:</strong> camera, microphone, and media library access only when you choose to capture or select content. We do not scan your device media in the background.</li>
      <li><strong>Push Notifications:</strong> a device push token, used to deliver notifications you opt into.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising Identifiers:</strong> if ads are shown (e.g., Google Mobile Ads), ad networks may receive device identifiers to deliver and measure advertising.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide and improve the App’s features (posting, messaging, profiles, discovery, live/voice/video interactions).</li>
      <li>Operate secure authentication, protect against abuse (e.g., App Check), and maintain service integrity.</li>
      <li>Deliver push notifications you request (e.g., messages, likes, follows).</li>
      <li>Enable optional location tags and geofeatures when you grant permission.</li>
      <li>Show ads where applicable and measure their performance.</li>
      <li>Comply with legal obligations and enforce our terms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Service Providers</h2>
    <p>We use reputable providers to operate the App. Depending on your region and configuration, data may be processed by one or more of the following:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firebase</strong> (e.g., Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Messaging).</li>
      <li><strong>Supabase</strong> (database and storage services).</li>
      <li><strong>LiveKit / WebRTC</strong> (real-time audio/video streaming for calls or live features).</li>
      <li><strong>Google Mobile Ads</strong> (ad delivery and measurement).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These providers may process data on our behalf to deliver core functionality, security, and reliability.</p>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not sell your personal information.</li>
      <li>We share information with service providers solely to operate the App.</li>
      <li>We may disclose information if required by law, to protect rights, safety, or investigate abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You can access, update, or delete your account information within the App where available, or by contacting us.</li>
      <li><strong>Request account deletion:</strong> <a href="mailto:equalsystemsstudio@gmail.com?subject=Account%20Deletion%20Request&body=Please%20delete%20my%20account.%20Include%20your%20username%20or%20registered%20email%20for%20verification.">equalsystemsstudio@gmail.com</a></li>

      <li>You can opt out of personalized advertising through your device’s ad settings.</li>

    <p>We retain information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the App. When you delete content or your account, related data is removed or de‑identified within a reasonable period, subject to legal requirements and technical limitations (e.g., backups).</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or the age required in your jurisdiction). If you believe a child has provided us personal information, please contact us and we will take appropriate steps to remove it.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We use industry‑standard safeguards to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure; we work to continuously improve protections.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Your information may be processed and stored in countries other than your own. By using the App, you consent to such transfers, subject to applicable laws.</p>
